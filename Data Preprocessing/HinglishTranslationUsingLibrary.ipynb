But then I started noticing that my online activity felt different, slower even. I can't even describe it well because everything seemed normal, except for the fact that I was constantly getting logged out of my accounts. Honestly, it’s such a mess, and I don’t even know where to start. I’ve contacted support, but they keep giving me the runaround. The more I tried to fix it, the more problems came up. My work account was recived, and then I got locked out of everything. I don’t think I’ve ever felt this violated before. My privacy is completely shattered, and I can’t do anything to make it stop. Even my phone isn’t working right anymore. It’s so stange how everything just fell apart after that one email.\n",

Then, suddenly, I got this weird notification asking me to update my password, but the message didn’t look like the usual ones I receive from the app. It looked a bit off. I don't know how, but it’s like they knew everything I was doing, even though I was trying to be careful. It’s terrifying to think about. The more I tried to fix it, the more problems came up. My work account was frezzing, and then I got locked out of everything. This has really left me anxious and frustrated, I can’t sleep knowing my information is out there. I’ve even considered deleting all my accounts, but that’s not a solution. Even my tablet isn’t working right anymore. It’s so stange how everything just fell apart after that one email.\n",
